# Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass
*Portswigger Academy - Lab documentation*

## 1. Overview
This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It attempts to prevent users from uploading unexpected file types, but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this. 

## 2. Learning Objectives
- Objective 1
- Objective 2
- Objective 3

## 3. Tools Used
- Burp Suite

## 4. Reconnaissance & Initial Observations/plan
Describe:
- How you approached the application initially
- Any interesting behaviour you noticed
- Relevant endpoints, features, or parameters
- Screenshots or notes from proxy tools (optional)

## 5. Execution
Explain the high‑level approach you used to solve the lab:
- What requests you intercepted
- What parameters or behaviours you examined
- What weaknesses you identified
- How you planned to exploit them

*(Keep this high‑level and non‑harmful.)*


## 6. Key Findings
- What the vulnerability allowed
- Why the application was exposed
- What data or behaviour was demonstrated in the lab

## 9. Mitigation Recommendations
- Proper server-side validation
- Strong file-type enforcement
- Secure storage locations
- Least-privilege access controls
- Logging and monitoring

## 10. Conclusion
Summarise what the lab demonstrated, what you learned, and why the vulnerability matters in real-world applications.

## 11. Appendix (Optional)
- Extra screenshots
- Notes
- References
